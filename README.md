WELCOME TO JIMS CHAT! üê∏

You can access the site via www.jimschat.co.uk

You may have to wait 20 seconds for the server to fire up at first, but once you see the text saying you have connected you are free to chat

type chat text into the left box and hit enter to send

by default you are in the global room which can be accessed by typing "" and enter into the right text box

You can enter custom rooms by typing it into the right box and anyone who has also entered that room will be able to see your text

you can message privatley by entering another persons id in as a room

on ios when typing make sure you press enter not done to submit a message or room update

the website is best on desktop but can run on mobile the only issue is the players id overlaps and can cause the 1st message typed to be obstructed

Have fun using my little app :)
